# GPU_Performance_Analysis_Using-Python_-_Jupyter
Title: GPU Performance Analysis using Python - An exploratory data analysis and regression-based study to understand factors affecting GPU performance using Kaggle data, visualization, and linear regression metrics.

# About GPU Performance Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing GPU performance metrics using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and linear regression modeling. The goal is to identify key factors influencing GPU performance and derive meaningful insights through data visualization and statistical evaluation.

## Python Libraries and Tool Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle
- Cleaned and filtered to retain relevant features

## Methodology
1. Collected GPU performance dataset from Kaggle
2. Cleaned the dataset to desired columns
3. Identified research questions related to GPU performance
4. Answered research questions using data visualization
5. Provided interpretation and insights for each graph
6. Built a Linear Regression model
7. Evaluated model performance using:
   - R² Score
   - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
8. Conclusion, limitations, and future improvements
